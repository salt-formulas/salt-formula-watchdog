    example: 1
  log_verbose:
    description: |
        Possible options: yes/no. "Yes" sends all debug info to the syslog
        and should be used for unusual cases only. It will generate a lot of

  pidfile:
    description: |
      The watchdog daemon can be configured to check for the running of other
      daemons by means of these PID files. When this test is enabled,
      the watchdog tries to open the PID file and read the numeric value of
      the PID from it, then it uses the kill() function to attempt to send
      the null (zero) signal to this process to check it is running
    type: string
    example: /var/run/rsyslogd.pid
  realtime:
    description: |
      If set to yes watchdog will lock itself into memory so it is never swapped out

    description: |

    type: integer
  max_load_1:
    description: |
     Set the maximal allowed load average for a 1 minute  span.  Once
     this  load  average  is  reached the system is rebooted. Default
     value is 0. That means the load average check  is  disabled.  Be
     careful  not to this parameter too low. To set a value less then
     the predefined minimal value of  2,  you  have  to  use  the  -f
     commandline option.
    type: number
  max_load_5:
    description: |
      Set  the  maximal allowed load average for a 5 minute span. Once
      this load average is reached the  system  is  rebooted.  Default
      value  is  3/4*max-load-1.  Be careful not to this parameter too
      low. To set a value less then the predefined minimal value of 2,
      you have to use the -f commandline option.
    type: number
  max_load_15:
    description: |
      Set  the maximal allowed load average for a 15 minute span. Once
      this load average is reached the  system  is  rebooted.  Default
      value  is  1/2*max-load-1.  Be careful not to this parameter too
      low. To set a value less then the predefined minimal value of 2,
